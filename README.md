# EatTogether

Web Development exercise based on the idea of a social platform with the aim of finding people to enjoy meals with in your area.

Tentative implementation with PHP, Bootstrap 5.3, XAMPP and JQuery5.

TODO:

private messages:
- ajax: make polling function to get new messages, change print in send function to callback
- make PM chats from modal into offcanvas
- add "read" column to PMs in database (timestamp? tinyint/bool easier?)
- switch message icon if unread messages > 0
- troubleshoot invite to group via chat windows
- additionally implement invite to group elsewhere for easier access

user accounts:  
- make public account page
- add hyperlink to user-images on index page
- change more button text into icons (don't forget title for hover text)
- fix grid on index page (cards overlap in smaller browser window)

other:
- think of what to use search bar for
